# PTSP ParticleSwarm
Run the PTSP code to solve the travelling salesman problem

Code Flow
1. The code first initially finds the shortest distance possible based on the data provided. This means it first does not regard demand
2. Once it obtains the shortest possible score it then uses it for the distance metric for the Multi-objective Genetic algorithm
